## Hey there, fellow energy trader

I was casually browsing this repo and couldn't help but notice a few... *souvenirs* left behind:

- 3 API keys chilling in plain sight like tourists at the beach
- A PostgreSQL password that is literally the word `streamlit`
- A corporate email just vibing in the source code

If this repo is public, congratulations -- you're running an open-source secrets manager. The most transparent one on the market, actually. Zero-knowledge? More like zero-privacy.

> "Security is just a state of mind."
> -- Someone who also hardcodes API keys

## But seriously

This is genuinely impressive work -- energy market fundamentals, ML forecasting, Solcast integration, ENTSO-E data pipelines, the whole stack. You clearly know what you're doing on the trading side. The code just needs a little... *wardrobe adjustment* before going out in public.

## So... about that part-time gig

Look, so when I found this repo I didn't just understand it -- I started reviewing it. The ML pipeline, the Solcast data, the ENTSO-E fundamentals -- solid work. I also have *opinions* on how to make it better.

If you need someone part-time to:

- Bounce ideas off (I'm cheaper than ChatGPT and slightly more opinionated)
- Contribute on the data/ML side
- Help you move your API keys somewhere that isn't, you know, *GitHub*

...then hit me up. I'm absolutely a developer-for-hire, and right now I'm offering a *friends and family discount* -- mostly because I've already seen your passwords anyway.

Worst case, you get free security consulting. Best case, we build something great and split the profits from all the Solcast API calls I *didn't* make with your exposed key.

You know where to find me. I already know where to find your passwords.

*Left with love, light trolling, and genuine interest. Make this repo private, frate.*
